#Marble Dropping Simulation

This project simulates the random dropping of marbles onto a rectangular table containing a circular tray and a rectangular tray. It calculates the probability of marbles landing in each tray, estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method, and provides a visualization of the results.

#Features

Simulates millions of marble drops using NumPy for efficient calculations.

Estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method.

Visualizes the simulation results with Matplotlib.

Supports custom table, tray sizes, and positions.
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.

#Installation

Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
git clone https://github.com/Sasmitha000/Monte-Carlo-Simulation.git

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional): Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

#install the libraries manually:

pip install numpy matplotlib


#Run the simulation script:

Expected Output

The number of marbles that land in each tray.
The estimated value of π.
A visualization of the simulation is displayed using Matplotlib.
